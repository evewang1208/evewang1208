Hi, I'm Eve. In my previous and current experience, I provided crucial support to the Quant portfolio manager desk by overseeing trades, ensuring portfolio integrity, and aligning holdings with strategic objectives. Furthermore, I developed a Python-based swap curve monitor, optimizing fixed income strategy exposure through proposed trades. Additionally, I played a pivotal role in the systematic strategy development for equities and commodities, leveraging industry research, signal analysis, and Python-based backtesting. This holistic approach significantly improved trading strategies and contributed to overall investment success. My ambition to transition into a quantitative trader continues to drive my dedication to learning new skills and staying at the forefront of financial innovation
